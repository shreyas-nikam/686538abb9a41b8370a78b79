In this lab, we explore various derivative pricing models and concepts. The application allows users to interact with key financial models, adjust parameters, and visualize the results in real-time. The main concepts covered are:

1. **Binomial Option Pricing Model**: A method for valuing options using a discrete-time model of the varying price over time of the financial instrument underlying the option.

2. **Put-Call Parity**: A principle that defines the relationship between the price of European put options and European call options of the same class, that is, with the same underlying asset, strike price, and expiration date.

3. **Forward Price Formula**: A model used to determine the price today at which an asset can be bought at a future date.

4. **Forward Rate Agreement (FRA)**: A contract that ensures a specific rate is guaranteed for a future deposit.

Each of these concepts is explored in detail in their respective pages. You can navigate between them using the sidebar.

This interactive application allows you to:
- Upload synthetic datasets
- Adjust key parameters
- Visualize the impact of parameter changes on derivative values
- Understand the underlying mathematical concepts through interactive examples

Let's dive in and explore the world of derivative pricing!
