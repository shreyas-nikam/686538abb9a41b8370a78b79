In this lab, we explore various derivative pricing models and concepts, including the Binomial Option Pricing Model, Put-Call Parity, Forward Price Formula, and Forward Rate Agreement (FRA). These models are essential for understanding and valuing financial derivatives.

1. **Binomial Option Pricing Model**: This model calculates the theoretical value of options using a discrete-time framework. It considers the possible up and down movements of the underlying asset price over time.

2. **Put-Call Parity**: This principle establishes a relationship between the prices of European put and call options with the same strike price and expiration date.

3. **Forward Price Formula**: This formula determines the price today at which an asset can be bought or sold for delivery at a future date.

4. **Forward Rate Agreement (FRA)**: This is a contract that guarantees a specific interest rate for a future deposit or loan.

Use the navigation menu on the left to explore each concept in detail and perform calculations with interactive inputs.
