In this lab, we explore various derivative pricing models and concepts, including:

1. Binomial Option Pricing Model
2. Put-Call Parity
3. Forward Price Formula
4. Forward Rate Agreement (FRA)

These models are essential for understanding and valuing financial derivatives. Let's break down each concept:

### Binomial Option Pricing Model

The binomial option pricing model calculates the theoretical value for options using a binomial tree. The model uses the following formula:

$$C_0 = rac{\pi C_u + (1 - \pi) C_d}{1 + r}$$

Where:
- $C_0$: Call option price at time 0
- $C_u$: Call option price if the underlying asset price goes up
- $C_d$: Call option price if the underlying asset price goes down
- $\pi$: Risk-neutral probability of an upward move
- $r$: Risk-free interest rate

The risk-neutral probability is calculated as:

$$\pi = rac{1 + r - d}{u - d}$$

Where:
- $u$: Up factor
- $d$: Down factor

### Put-Call Parity

Put-Call Parity establishes a relationship between European put and call options:

$$S_0 + P_0 = c_0 + rac{X}{(1 + r)^T}$$

Where:
- $S_0$: Current price of the underlying asset
- $P_0$: Current price of the European put option
- $c_0$: Current price of the European call option
- $X$: Strike price of the options
- $r$: Risk-free interest rate
- $T$: Time to expiration

### Forward Price Formula

The forward price formula determines the price today at which an asset can be bought at a future date:

$$F_0 = S_0(1 + r)^T$$

Where:
- $F_0$: Forward price
- $S_0$: Current spot price
- $r$: Risk-free rate
- $T$: Time until expiration

### Forward Rate Agreement (FRA)

A forward rate agreement ensures a specific rate for a future deposit:

$$	ext{Settlement at maturity} = N \times \frac{(R_K - R_F) \times \frac{d}{360}}{1 + R_K \frac{d}{360}}$$

Where:
- $N$: The notional principal
- $R_k$: The interest rate for the term the FRA is trying to cover
- $R_F$: The rate in the FRA agreement to be paid
- $d$: Number of days
