    ## Exploring More Complex Derivatives

    This page delves into some more advanced concepts in derivative pricing, including the impact of volatility and correlation.

    ### Volatility and Option Pricing

    Volatility, a measure of the price fluctuations of an underlying asset, plays a crucial role in option pricing. Higher volatility generally increases option prices, as it increases the potential range of outcomes.

    The Black-Scholes model is a cornerstone of option pricing theory:

    $$
    C = S N(d_1) - K e^{-rT} N(d_2)
    $$

    Where:
    *   \(C\) is the call option price,
    *   \(S\) is the current stock price,
    *   \(K\) is the option's strike price,
    *   \(r\) is the risk-free interest rate,
    *   \(T\) is the time to maturity,
    *   \(N(x)\) is the cumulative standard normal distribution function,
    *   \(d_1\) and \(d_2\) are model-specific parameters.

    ### Correlation and Multi-Asset Derivatives

    Correlation measures the degree to which two assets move together. In multi-asset derivatives, such as basket options, correlation significantly impacts the price.
