# Forward Price Formula

The forward price formula determines the price today at which an asset can be bought at a future date:

$$F_0 = S_0e^{rT}$$

Where:
- $F_0$: Forward price
- $S_0$: Current spot price
- $r$: Risk-free rate
- $T$: Time until expiration

This formula assumes continuous compounding of the risk-free rate.
