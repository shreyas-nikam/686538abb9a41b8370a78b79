# Put-Call Parity

Put-Call Parity establishes a relationship between European put and call options with the same strike price and expiration date:

$$S_0 + P_0 = c_0 + \frac{X}{(1 + r)^T}$$

Where:
- $S_0$: Current price of the underlying asset
- $P_0$: Current price of the European put option
- $c_0$: Current price of the European call option
- $X$: Strike price of the options
- $r$: Risk-free interest rate
- $T$: Time to expiration
